        "\n",
        "The capacity tells us how much flow this edge can accomodate, at most. For example, if the edge was a road that connected two towns, it can accomodate 10 cars per minute. If we tried to send 11 cars per minute, we'll cause a traffic jam.\n",
        "\n",
        "Capacities, and flows, are typically expressed in unit time such as seconds, hours, etc. For example, a road has a capacity of 10 cars per minute, an wire has a capacity of $6.24\\times 10^8$ electrons per second, and a grocery register has a capacity of 20 clients per hour. In a flow graph, we do not show explicitly the units. We refer to the capacity just by its value, e.g., a \"capacity of 10\". The assumption is that we are in agreement of what that 10 means in the context of the graph we study (could be 10 cars a minute, 20 clients per hour, etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "When there is flow across an edge, we show its value too, with a second number: $u \\xrightarrow{5/10} v$ indicates that there is a flow of 5 (something per some unit time) across an edge that can accommodate up to 10 somethings per unit time.\n",

        "If we wish to be dramatic, we could write $u \\xrightarrow{0/10} v$ to emphasize that there is no flow over an edge. In desperate situations, we may even write $u \\xrightarrow{0} v$ to indicate an edge with 0 capacity; though it may be best if we just admitted there is no edge between $u$ and $v$.
